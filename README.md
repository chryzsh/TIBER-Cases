# TIBER-Cases
TIBER-Cases is a project created to give cases of `The Hive` platform for Threat Intelligence Analysts mainly. All the cases generated are mapped to TIBER-EU processes.

TIBER-EU process is complex to implement in order to work in an agile way. It takes a lot of intercommunication between different departments and suppliers.

The cases generated for `The Hive` have the main objective of quickly implementing the tasks that the Threat Intelligence team has to perform. In this way, work agility is achieved.

# TIBER-EU
How they define themselves is: TIBER-EU is the European framework for threat intelligence-based ethical red-teaming. It is the first EU-wide guide on how authorities, entities and threat intelligence and red-team providers should work together to test and improve the cyber resilience of entities by carrying out a controlled cyberattack.

# Process
To simplify the entire TIBER-EU document and the Threat Intelligence section a bit, I wanted to make a process explaining the most important points of the framework for those analysts who are going to work on it. Specifically, I have focused on the "Processes/Activities Threat Intelligence" section of the official TIBER-EU process.
