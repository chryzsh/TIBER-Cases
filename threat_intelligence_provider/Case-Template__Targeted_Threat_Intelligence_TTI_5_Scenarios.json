The scenarios must be mapped with the MITER ATT&CK matrix in addition to each command execution that applies (procedures). It is of vital importance that the scenarios are as real as possible to those executed by the actors identified in the threat modeling. In this way, the `Entity` will be able to get closer to the greatest possible reality in the event of an attack, thus subsequently, through its blue team, verifying if there was visibility of the RT exercises.\n\n# Kill Chain\n\nAll the scenarios described must be mapped to the kill chain, describing what the red teamer has to do in each phase. The phases of the kill chain are the following:\n1. Reconnaissance\n2. Weaponization\n3. Delivery\n4. Exploitation\n5. Installation\n6. C2\n7. Actions on Objectives\n\n# Outcome\n\nThe outcome is a report with all the scenarios described with the following information:\n- Techniques\n- Tactics\n- Procedures\n\nIs important to follow the same structure for each scenario described.",

Persistence using a binary which can create a file in the StartUp path.\n3. Persistence using a ps1 script which uses Set-ItemProperty to set new registry key.\n\nA good resource to create scenarios in a structured format with techniques, tactics and procedures are the AC3 Threat Sightings.
