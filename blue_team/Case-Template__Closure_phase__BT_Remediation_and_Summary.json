The Test Summary Report should not contain detailed technical information and findings regarding weaknesses and vulnerabilities, as information at that level of detail is highly sensitive and for the entity only. The entity must share the Test Summary Report with the lead authority. The lead authority may also review the more detailed findings from the test if this is deemed necessary.","severity":2,"tags":["TIBER","BT"],"flag":false,"tlp":2,"pap":2,"tasks":[{"id":"~4325384","_id":"~4325384","createdBy":"joseliyo_jstnk@example.org","createdAt":1644425752677,"_type":"case_task","title":"Task #2 - Test Summary Report","group":"Entity - Multiple teams","description":"# Dependencies\n\nThis task has dependency on the following reports.\n\n- Red Team Test Report\n- Blue Team Report\n- TTI Report\n- Red Team Test Plan\n- Remediation Plan\n\n# Goal\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this is not a technical report.
