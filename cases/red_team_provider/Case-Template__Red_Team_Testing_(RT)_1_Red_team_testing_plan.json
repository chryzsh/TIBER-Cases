After understanding this information, the red team must define the scope of the tests. Which critical functions are left out and which are not. This is critical, since there will be some CF that are not in the scope and can cause loss of time for the team.\n\nFinally, the red team must define the execution time of the tests. This allows the white team to follow the test during the execution.\n\n# Outcome\n\nThe outcome of this case will be a summary email or report where is defined the final scope and the execution time of the test. This summary must be sent to the `Entity`.","severity":2,"tags":["RT","TIBER"],"flag":false,"tlp":2,"pap":2,"tasks":[{"id":"~4227080","_id":"~4227080","createdBy":"joseliyo_jstnk@example.org","createdAt":1644366361017,"_type":"case_task","title":"Task #2 - Meet with the threat intelligence team","group":"Red Team & Threat Intelligence Team","description":"# Dependencies\n\nThis task has dependency on GTL Report and TTI Report from the threat intelligence provider.\n\n# Goal\n\nBoth teams must meet to discuss the reports generated by the threat intelligence team.\n\nThe threat intelligence team must explain in detail everything described in the reports, since the information that appears in them could define the scope and basis for the scenarios that the red team team will later generate.\n\n1.

Methods of communication with the White Team to expedite the implementation of said services and also how confidential information will be exchanged.\n\nFor example, in the Red Team Test Plan, the RT provider should share all infrastructure, domain names, hashes, emails (i.e. so called indicators of attack), used by the RT provider, with the White Team and TCT before the test starts. This will allow the White Team to differentiate between the TIBER test and potentially real attacks, and allow the White Team to take the appropriate steps to manage a potentially real cyber attack. \n","status":"Waiting","flag":false,"order":2}],"status":"Ok","customFields":{},"metrics":{}}
