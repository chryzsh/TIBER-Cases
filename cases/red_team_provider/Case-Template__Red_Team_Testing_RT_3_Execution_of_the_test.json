If obstacles occur during the test, the red team should **show its creativity** (as advanced attackers would). \n\nIrrespective of the methodology used by the RT provider, the test should be conducted in a controlled manner, taking a stage-by-stage approach, and in a way that does not bring risks to the entity and its critical functions. It is important for the White Team to be continuously informed about progress being made at each stage, as soon as a flag or target is in sight, or at least when the red team provider has achieved the \"capture the flag\" moment.",
