The goal of this workshop is to learn from the testing experience in collaboration with the RT provider. During the workshop, a replay is organised in which the BT and the RT provider review the steps taken by both parties during the test.\n\nAdditionally, a purple teaming element can be added, in which the BT and the RT provider work together to see which other steps could have been taken by the RT provider and how the BT could have responded to those steps.","severity":2,"tags":["TIBER","BT","RT"],"flag":false,"tlp":2,"pap":2,"tasks":[{"id":"~4227184","_id":"~4227184","createdBy":"joseliyo_jstnk@example.org","createdAt":1644426488615,"_type":"case_task","title":"Task #1 - Repeat those undetected steps by the blue team","group":"Red Team","description":"# Dependencies\n\nThis task has dependency on `Closure Blue Team #1 - Report`, specifically the outcome on unidentified steps.\n\n# Goal\n\nYour goal is to repeat all those steps that **the blue team was not able to detect when the tests were launched without their knowledge.**\n\nEach time a step is executed, the blue team must be notified before and after the step.
