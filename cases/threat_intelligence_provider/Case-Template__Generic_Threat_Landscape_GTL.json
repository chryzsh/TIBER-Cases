  "description": "| Phase | Step | Outcome |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Generic Threat Landscape | 1 of 1 | GTL Report with interesting adversaries mapped to past events. |\n\n# Tasks\n\n- `Task #1 - Source Collection`\n- `Task #2 - Focus criteria`\n- `Task #3 - GTL Report`\n\n# Know your adversary - External intelligence\n\nGeneric Threat Landscape Case. This case should be elaborated using public reports from different sources such as:\n\n- External reports from cybersecurity companies\n- ISACs reports (FS-ISAC)\n- Government Agencies\n\n# Focus criteria\n\nThe analyst have to focus on obtain information based on three different ways.\n\n1. The information need to be mapped only for the financial sector. Those threats that are not carrying out campaigns against financial sector are considered not interesting, since the scope need to be reduced. Is recommended first focus on threat for financial sector that are doing activities in the country of  the`Entity`. After that, you will move to threats from other countries.\n2. Geopolitical Considerations of the country where the `Entity` is. Each country has differents jurisdiction, for that reason this point will be unique for each country even for each `Entity`.\n3. Criminal Threats related to the country as well. Each country has different types of  threats. Also, the `Entity` could have been targeted by any threat in the past.\n\nIs important to keep in mind that this report is generic, that is, it is not specific to the `Entity`. However, this report is the entry point for the TTI Report. For that reason, is recommened to create the GTL report. In case you don't have time to create it, you can go only with the reports collected from public sources.\n\n# Outcome\n\nThe outcome of this case will be a list of adversaries that are potentially threats for the `Entity`. Together with those adversaries it is interesting to map the events carried out by them as well. Thus will be easier for the analyst in the next phases get information abour capabilities and techniques used by the adversaries.\n\n# Resources\n\nSome good resources related to Financial Threats are the following:\n\n- Financial Services Information Sharing and analysis Center | https://www.fsisac.com/\n- Nordic Financial CERT | https://www.nfcert.org/\n- Colombia Financial CSIRT| https://csirtasobancaria.com/\n- Bank Security Twitter Account | https://twitter.com/Bank_Security\n\nSome good resources for generic threats (where financial is included) are the following:\n\n- Trellix | https://www.trellix.com/\n- SecureList by Kaspersky | https://securelist.com/\n- Mandiant | https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog\n- CrowdStrike | https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/\n- Microsoft Security | https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/\n- Talos by Cisco | https://blog.talosintelligence.com/\n- Sentinel Labs | https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/\n- Symantec | https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence\n- Sophos Labs | https://www.sophos.com/en-us/labs\n- Fortinet | https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research\n- Checkpoint | https://research.checkpoint.com/category/threat-research/",
